	    <h2>What's the background of Cat Mania?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Around ten years ago, a small but tight-knit group of friends were discussing their pet cats, when the idea of founding 
		a way for ailurophiles (that means cat lover) to connect with each other. Cat Mania was established not long after. Originally 
		a small, locally based group, Cat Mania began to see exponential growth, expanding across borders and, thanks to the Internet, 
		connecting thousands of cat lovers from all over the world.<br><br>
		Cat Mania draws in members from all different demographics; old and young, rich and poor, and our members come from a variety of
		different cultural backgrounds. Despite our differences, we are united in our fondness of our house cats.<br><br>
		Despite our growth, we retain the ultimate respect for our humble beginnings, and we aim to never lose sight of our goal of
		network with cat loving folk. We are non-profit, and our website is run by volunteers. It's not about the money; it's about our
		furry friends.</p>

		<h2>Should I become a member of Cat Mania?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Of course. By joining, you'll gain access to our blog posts as well as access to our members' lounge, where you are free to meet
		many like-minded cat lovers. You'll be granted access to thousands of images and videos of cats made by our members, and you'll also be
		able to share your own. In addition, we also provide advice on cat ownership, such as how to keep you cat happy, how to look after your
		cat's health, amongst many other things.<br><br>
		We also love to host fun activities, such as movie/games nights (not necessarily cat related!) as well as cat picture contests, where
		the most adorable kitten wins. Could yours be crowned champion?<br><br>
		Membership of Cat Mania is free, we do not charge any fees.</p>

		<h2>Do I need to own a cat to join?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Of course not, you don't necessarily even have to be a cat owner! Whether you're curious about why people could have so much love
		for felines, or whether you are head over heels for them, we do not discriminate and welcome all interested members.</p>
