		<p id="cm_intro">We are the premier website for cat fanatics - or fanaticats - to come together and share our
		love for our four-legged, whiskered friends. Whether you're a crazy cat lady, or perhaps someone simply curious about felines,
		we provide an array of cat content and means to tell the world how much you adore kitties.</p>
		<h2>Why do we love cats?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Our feline pals are not just toys; it is scientifically proven that they provide human beings with joy and comfort - and, sometimes
		that joy and comfort can be intense!
		<br><br>
		Human relationship with cats go back thousands of years, beginning almost 10,000 years ago. The ancient Egyptians were fond of cats, even
		believing that they possessed divine energy. Although cats are mostly kept as pets today, humans originally kept them around as a form
		of pest control, as cats are known to hunt rodents. Starting in the 19th century, cats began to be kept as pets, rather than just
		pest control; humans now valued their company more than their utility.
		<br><br>
		Cats can help people, particularly their masters, in many ways. They can help relieve loneliness, provide feelings of affection, 
		and make us feel comfortable. They are also able to reduce stress, as a positive relationship with a cat releases oxytocin, 
		a stress suppressor. One survey found that those who spend time with cats feel calmer and less upset than those who don't.
		Benefits of owning cats can even come in physical ways; one study found that cat owners have a lower risk of heart
		attacks than those who do not own cats.
		<br><br>
		Clearly, there are many reasons to adore our kitties. They don't just make us feel good, they are <i>known</i> to make us feel better!</p>
